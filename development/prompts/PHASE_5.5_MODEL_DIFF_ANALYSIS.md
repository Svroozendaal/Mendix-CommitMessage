# PHASE_5.5_MODEL_DIFF_ANALYSIS
## Goal

Analyse and present model-level changes for Mendix project files.

## Entry Criteria

1. Relevant model-diff scope is defined.
2. Clarifying workflow questions have been asked as needed.

## Required First Action

1. Read `development/AGENTS.md`.
2. Ask workflow questions first.
3. Ask which skills should be used and suggest relevant defaults.
4. Load Mendix-specific rules from `development/skills/mendix-studio-pro-10/SKILL.md`.

## Tasks

1. Pause at `WAIT_FOR_APPROVAL` before implementation changes, unless `AUTO_APPROVE` is explicit.
2. Confirm model diff scope and expected output.
3. Implement or refine model diff parsing.
4. Validate performance and failure handling.
5. Document behaviour and limitations.

## Exit Criteria

1. Model-diff behaviour is implemented or updated.
2. Validation and limitations are documented.
3. Hand-off notes are complete.
