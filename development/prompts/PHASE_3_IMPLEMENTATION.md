# PHASE_3_IMPLEMENTATION
## Goal

Implement approved changes safely and incrementally.

## Entry Criteria

1. Planning output and acceptance criteria are available.
2. Clarifying workflow questions have been asked as needed.

## Required First Action

1. Read `development/AGENTS.md`.
2. Ask workflow questions first.
3. Ask which skills should be used and suggest relevant defaults.

## Tasks

1. Pause at `WAIT_FOR_APPROVAL` before implementation changes, unless `AUTO_APPROVE` is explicit.
2. Implement against approved contracts only.
3. Validate after each logical change.
4. Track completed work in `PROGRESS.md`.
5. Prepare clear hand-off notes for testing.

## Exit Criteria

1. Approved scope changes are implemented.
2. Validation evidence is recorded.
3. Testing hand-off is complete.
