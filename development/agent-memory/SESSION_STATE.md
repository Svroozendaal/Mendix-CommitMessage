## HANDOFF - Implementer - 2026-02-18
STATUS: COMPLETE
NEXT_AGENT: Tester
SUMMARY: Phase 6 export pipeline implemented and aligned with Phase 7 folder and schema contract.
BLOCKERS: Build verification currently blocked by local file access and lock restrictions in this environment.

## HANDOFF - Implementer - 2026-02-18
STATUS: COMPLETE
NEXT_AGENT: Tester
SUMMARY: Model-diff analysis now performs resource ownership attribution for nested `.mpr` changes, enabling modified microflow/page/entity detection and added coverage for nanoflows and other document resources.
BLOCKERS: Deployment copy to the target Mendix app path failed due DLL access denial; build itself succeeded.

## HANDOFF - Implementer - 2026-02-18
STATUS: COMPLETE
NEXT_AGENT: Tester
SUMMARY: Added element-level model details (microflow action usage and entity added attribute names), persisted full model dump artifacts under `mendix-data/dumps` on export, and propagated model details into structured parser output.
BLOCKERS: none

## HANDOFF - Implementer - 2026-02-18
STATUS: COMPLETE
NEXT_AGENT: Tester
SUMMARY: Resolved stale pane fallback risk by removing legacy pane registration and adding URL cache-busting; hardened model analysis against temp `mprcontents` failures by reconstructing HEAD contents from Git tree and handling dump environment exceptions gracefully.
BLOCKERS: none

## HANDOFF - Implementer - 2026-02-18
STATUS: COMPLETE
NEXT_AGENT: Tester
SUMMARY: Added explicit refresh API/UI reload messaging, enriched microflow action details with readable descriptors, and created a dedicated model dump inspection skill under `development/skills`.
BLOCKERS: none

## HANDOFF - Implementer - 2026-02-18
STATUS: COMPLETE
NEXT_AGENT: Tester
SUMMARY: Added second-level action detail output with assignment expressions and retrieve metadata, then rebuilt and redeployed the extension to the target Mendix app.
BLOCKERS: none

## HANDOFF - Implementer - 2026-02-18
STATUS: COMPLETE
NEXT_AGENT: Tester
SUMMARY: Refactored Phase 7 parser to emit structured schema `2.0` (file summaries, model aggregations, commit-message context) and added startup backlog processing for existing export files.
BLOCKERS: none

## HANDOFF - Documenter - 2026-02-18
STATUS: COMPLETE
NEXT_AGENT: Tester
SUMMARY: Updated extension/parser/data documentation to match the implemented refresh/UI and schema `2.0` behaviour, and added a dedicated `mendix-commit-structuring` skill plus prompt wiring.
BLOCKERS: Skill auto-validation script requires `PyYAML` in local Python and could not be executed as-is.
