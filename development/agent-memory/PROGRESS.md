## PROGRESS_ENTRY - 2026-02-18
SCOPE: Phase 6 data collection and export implementation aligned to Phase 7 parser input.
FILES_CHANGED: studio-pro-extension-csharp/GitChangesExportService.cs, studio-pro-extension-csharp/ExtensionDataPaths.cs, studio-pro-extension-csharp/ChangesPanel.cs, studio-pro-extension-csharp/ChangesPanel.Designer.cs, studio-pro-extension-csharp/GitChangesWebServerExtension.cs, studio-pro-extension-csharp/GitChangesPanelHtml.cs, studio-pro-extension-csharp/AutoCommitMessage.csproj, deploy-autocommitmessage.ps1, MendixCommitParser/Services/ParserDataPaths.cs, MendixCommitParser/Services/FileWatcherService.cs, MendixCommitParser/Storage/JsonStorage.cs, MendixCommitParser/Program.cs, studio-pro-extension-csharp/README.md, mendix-data/*
VALIDATION: Build attempts blocked by local file access/lock restrictions; static verification completed against parser contract and data-path flow.
NOTES: Repo-local data root contract established (`mendix-data/exports|processed|errors|structured`) with build-time extension configuration and parser fallback alignment.

## PROGRESS_ENTRY - 2026-02-18
SCOPE: Extend Phase 6 model analysis to detect modified resources and additional Mendix resource types (including nanoflows and domain model resources).
FILES_CHANGED: studio-pro-extension-csharp/MendixModelDiffService.cs, studio-pro-extension-csharp/MendixModelChange.cs, studio-pro-extension-csharp/README.md, development/agent-memory/DECISIONS_LOG.md, development/agent-memory/PROGRESS.md
VALIDATION: `dotnet build .\\studio-pro-extension-csharp\\AutoCommitMessage.csproj -c Debug -t:Compile` passed with 0 warnings and 0 errors; `deploy-autocommitmessage.ps1 -DataRootPath "C:\\Workspace\\Mendix-AutoCommitMessage\\mendix-data"` built successfully and failed only at the final copy step due target DLL access denial.
NOTES: Code-level validation and deployment build pass are confirmed; deployment requires releasing lock/access on the target extension DLL in the Mendix app folder.

## PROGRESS_ENTRY - 2026-02-18
SCOPE: Add deep model-change detail extraction (microflow actions, entity added attributes), persist full model dumps, and retain model details in structured parser output.
FILES_CHANGED: studio-pro-extension-csharp/MendixModelDiffService.cs, studio-pro-extension-csharp/GitChangesService.cs, studio-pro-extension-csharp/GitChangesPayload.cs, studio-pro-extension-csharp/GitChangesExportService.cs, studio-pro-extension-csharp/GitChangesWebServerExtension.cs, studio-pro-extension-csharp/ExtensionDataPaths.cs, deploy-autocommitmessage.ps1, MendixCommitParser/Models/RawCommitData.cs, MendixCommitParser/Models/StructuredCommitData.cs, MendixCommitParser/Services/CommitParserService.cs, studio-pro-extension-csharp/README.md, mendix-data/README.md, development/agent-memory/DECISIONS_LOG.md, development/agent-memory/PROGRESS.md
VALIDATION: `dotnet build .\\studio-pro-extension-csharp\\AutoCommitMessage.csproj -c Debug` passed with 0 warnings and 0 errors; `dotnet build .\\MendixCommitParser\\MendixCommitParser.csproj -c Debug` passed after releasing locked parser processes; parser run produced structured output containing `modelChanges` and `modelDumpArtifacts`.
NOTES: Dump persistence is export-scoped (`persistModelDumps: true`) to avoid uncontrolled growth during passive pane refreshes.

## PROGRESS_ENTRY - 2026-02-18
SCOPE: Stabilise UI loading and harden model dump analysis against missing temp `mprcontents` failures after commit/reopen flows.
FILES_CHANGED: studio-pro-extension-csharp/GitChangesDockablePaneExtension.cs, studio-pro-extension-csharp/GitChangesService.cs, development/agent-memory/DECISIONS_LOG.md, development/agent-memory/PROGRESS.md
VALIDATION: `dotnet build .\\studio-pro-extension-csharp\\AutoCommitMessage.csproj -c Debug` passed; `deploy-autocommitmessage.ps1` deployed successfully to `C:\\Workspaces\\Mendix\\Smart Expenses app-main`.
NOTES: Webview URL now includes a per-open cache-buster token and HEAD `mprcontents` are reconstructed from Git tree where available.

## PROGRESS_ENTRY - 2026-02-18
SCOPE: Make refresh explicitly reload model analysis, enrich microflow action detail text, and document dump-inspection workflow as a reusable skill.
FILES_CHANGED: studio-pro-extension-csharp/ExtensionConstants.cs, studio-pro-extension-csharp/GitChangesWebServerExtension.cs, studio-pro-extension-csharp/GitChangesPanelHtml.cs, studio-pro-extension-csharp/MendixModelDiffService.cs, development/skills/mendix-model-dump-inspection/SKILL.md, development/AGENTS.md, development/agent-memory/DECISIONS_LOG.md, development/agent-memory/PROGRESS.md
VALIDATION: `dotnet build .\\studio-pro-extension-csharp\\AutoCommitMessage.csproj -c Debug` passed with 0 warnings/errors; `deploy-autocommitmessage.ps1` deployed successfully to `C:\\Workspaces\\Mendix\\Smart Expenses app-main`.
NOTES: Refresh now shows `Reloading Git + model changes...` and action detail strings include context such as association-based retrieves and changed member names.

## PROGRESS_ENTRY - 2026-02-18
SCOPE: Implement second-level microflow action detail extraction with value expressions and richer metadata.
FILES_CHANGED: studio-pro-extension-csharp/MendixModelDiffService.cs, development/skills/mendix-model-dump-inspection/SKILL.md, development/agent-memory/DECISIONS_LOG.md, development/agent-memory/PROGRESS.md
VALIDATION: `dotnet build .\\studio-pro-extension-csharp\\AutoCommitMessage.csproj -c Debug` passed with 0 warnings/errors; `deploy-autocommitmessage.ps1` deployed successfully to `C:\\Workspaces\\Mendix\\Smart Expenses app-main`.
NOTES: Action detail output now includes assignment-style summaries (`Attribute=$Expression`), retrieve `xPath/range/sort` details, and broader action coverage (`ChangeVariableAction`, `CreateVariableAction`, `DeleteAction`, and action-call descriptors).

## PROGRESS_ENTRY - 2026-02-18
SCOPE: Upgrade Phase 7 parser structure/process for commit-message-ready outputs based on latest export payloads.
FILES_CHANGED: MendixCommitParser/Models/RawCommitData.cs, MendixCommitParser/Models/StructuredCommitData.cs, MendixCommitParser/Services/CommitParserService.cs, MendixCommitParser/Services/EntityExtractorService.cs, MendixCommitParser/Services/FileWatcherService.cs, MendixCommitParser/Program.cs, mendix-data/README.md, development/agent-memory/DECISIONS_LOG.md, development/agent-memory/PROGRESS.md
VALIDATION: `dotnet build .\\MendixCommitParser\\MendixCommitParser.csproj -c Debug` passed with 0 warnings/errors; parser runtime replay confirmed startup backlog processing and generated schema `2.0` structured output with `files`, `modelSummary`, and `commitMessageContext`.
NOTES: Export backlog in `mendix-data/exports` is now processed on startup, and `.mpr` entities are derived from model changes instead of fallback `Unknown/App.mpr`.

## PROGRESS_ENTRY - 2026-02-18
SCOPE: Refresh informational documentation and skills for latest extension UI/refresh flow and parser schema/process changes.
FILES_CHANGED: studio-pro-extension-csharp/README.md, studio-pro-extension-csharp/info_studio-pro-extension-csharp.md, MendixCommitParser/README.md, mendix-data/README.md, development/skills/mendix-model-dump-inspection/SKILL.md, development/skills/mendix-studio-pro-10/SKILL.md, development/skills/mendix-commit-structuring/SKILL.md, development/AGENTS.md, development/prompts/PHASE_6_DATA_COLLECTION.md, development/prompts/PHASE_7_COMMIT_PARSER_AGENT.md, development/agent-memory/DECISIONS_LOG.md, development/agent-memory/PROGRESS.md
VALIDATION: Manual markdown and diff verification completed; `skill-creator` quick validator could not run because `PyYAML` is not installed in the local Python environment (`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'yaml'`).
NOTES: Added a new Phase 7 skill focused on structured output contracts and ensured prompts reference both commit structuring and model dump inspection workflows.
